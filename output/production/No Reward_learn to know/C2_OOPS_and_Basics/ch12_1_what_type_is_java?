Java is a 'hybrid language' both compiled as well as interpreted.

  |Java File| --(compiled)--> |Class File| --> can be used by java interpreter
  (harry.java)    javac       (harry.class)

>A JVM can be used to interpret this bytecode
>This bytecode can be taken to any platform ( win/ mac / Linux ) for education.
>Hence java is platform-independent ( write once run everywhere ).

Executing a java program:

java Harry java  -  compiles
java Harry class -  Interpreted

So far the execution of our program was being managed by IntelliJ idea.
we can download a source code like VS code to compile & execute our java programs
