Command-line arguments are values or parameters that you can pass to a program when you run
it from the command line or terminal. They provide a way to customize the behavior of a program
or provide it with input data without having to modify the source code of the program itself.
Command-line arguments are commonly used in command-line interfaces (CLI) and scripting.

Here's how command-line arguments work:

1. **Running a Program**: To run a program with command-line arguments, you typically open a
command prompt or terminal and enter a command that specifies the program you want to run, followed
 by one or more arguments.

2. **Accessing Command-Line Arguments**: Within the program's code, you can access the command-line
arguments provided by the user. These arguments are typically stored in an array or list-like data structure.

3. **Using Command-Line Arguments**: The program can then use these arguments to customize its behavior
 or process data provided by the user.

For example, consider a simple command-line program in Java that calculates the sum of two numbers provided
 as command-line arguments:

public class AddNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 2) {
            System.out.println("Usage: java AddNumbers <number1> <number2>");
            return;
        }

        double num1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
        double num2 = Double.parseDouble(args[1]);

        double sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}


In this example:

- `args` is an array of strings that holds the command-line arguments.
- The program checks if exactly two arguments are provided. If not, it displays a usage message.
- It then converts the two arguments to numbers, performs the addition, and prints the result.

You can run this program from the command line as follows:

'''terminal

java AddNumbers 5.5 3.2


In this case, `5.5` and `3.2` are the command-line arguments, and the program calculates and prints the sum `8.7`.

Command-line arguments are a convenient way to make your programs more versatile and customizable, as users can
 provide different inputs without needing to recompile or modify the code of the program itself.
