Creating/compiling a class inside a package in java:
(class must contain package name inside i.e. package package_name; in the beginning)

command 1: javac -d . class_name.java  (single class)

command 2: javac -d . *.java            (all classes)

 > the above command 1  will create a package directory
 > inside that directory there will be our class file (class_name.class)
 > command 2 will compile 'all classes' inside a directory to their respectable packages

Running a class inside a package:

command: java package_name.class_name
(command should be executed outside the package directory)

//----------------------------------------------------------

Creating/compiling a class without a package in java: (class not containing package name inside)

command: javac class_name.java

Running a class with no package:

command: java class_name

//----------------------------------------------------------
> We can also create packages inside a package.
> These packages once created can be used by other classes.
