Interpreted vs Compiled Languages!

Interpreter Vs Compiler :
 The interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code. On the other hand,
 the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code

Interpreter :
1. one statement at a time
2. An interpreter is needed every time
3. Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
4. Easy for programmers.
5. E.g. python, javascript, ruby

Compiler :
1. Entire program at a time
2. Once compiled, it is not needed (e.g. after .exe file you don't need compiler anymore)
3. No execution if an error occurs
4. Usually not as easy as interpreted once
5. C, C++, rust

Java is a hybrid language, both interpreted and complied
