//Now, let's suppose you want to overload an "add" method. The "add" method will accept one argument for the first
// time, and every time the number of arguments passed will be incremented by 1 till the number of arguments is equaled to 10.
//One approach to solve this problem is to overload the "add" method 10 times.
// But is it the optimal approach? What if I say that the number of arguments passed will be
// incremented by 1 till the number of arguments is equaled to 1000. Do you think that it is
// good practice to overload a method 1000 times?
//To solve this problem of method overloading, Variable Arguments(Varargs) were introduced with the release of JDK 5.
