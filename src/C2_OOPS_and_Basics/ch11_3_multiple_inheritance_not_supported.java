// multiple inheritance in JAVA is not allowed
// multiple inheritance in JAVA can be achieved through interfaces
//  are a better way to define things

// Difference between inheriting(extending) and implementing
// E.g.---> class smartphone 'extends' cellphone 'implements' gps, camera, mediaPlayer
// above is an example of polymorphism using interfaces and classes

// ** IMPORTANT ** refer to notes for more info...


// other info:
//> -- interface can 'extend' another interface to inherit methods
//> -- interface 'cannot implement' another interface to make a 'class'
//> fields declared inside interface are constant
//> Reference of interfaces can be created, but not the object
//> Interface methods are 'public' by default (even if you don't write)
