Java has three basic ways of building loops:

while loops – you use these when you 'don’t know' at the start of the loop how many times it will go around.

do-while loops - you use these when you 'don’t know' at the start of the loop how many times it will go
around but you do know it will be 'at least once'.

for loops – you use these when you 'do know at the start' of the loop how many times it will go around.
These also have a newer variant that we’ll get back to in a later chapter – usually called for-each loops.

for-each loops - for-each loop is a loop that can only be used on a 'collection of items'. It will loop
through the collection and each time through the loop it will use the next item from the collection. It
starts with the first item in the array (the one at index 0) and continues through in order to the last
item in the array.
